    "Two guys in the same lunch restaurant as me rn, asian place, they speak english even though they both are swedish. Hair hasnt been washed in a while, one has pyjamas wear and the other is dressed like a girl with fake tits. They are talking about marxism.\nThey refer to things in a internet way\nOne just said lmao\nInstead of laughing\nIm leaving",
    "I want to date Elina so bad. She is so cute and I love her so much. She has a cute smile and a cute face. She’s a gamer like me and has a amazing personality. I would love to tell her every night “I love you” and rub her feet while she is streaming. We would go out when she isn’t doing gamer stuff and have fun together. She is also really good at gaming so I would be able to get carried by my very own GF. I love girls who are better at things than me so I can learn from them. God I want to date Elina",
    "tonysimplenero: please let me use your panties like a coffee filter so I can start my day with a taste of your wap",
    "Today's stream was really good. Just keeping aside the cosplay and elina's personality, the vibe was alright. But getting back to the real stuff, there wasn't one second for the entire time that I watched that I could focus on anything other than ogling at elina like a caveman (maybe that has something to do with me as a person but idk). Even then, after doing almost 2.5km of swimming drills, after which I'm usually fucking hammered, I still managed to watch the stream till the end and I couldn't keep my eyes off again (red hair is my weakness and the DC cartoons made me fall in love with poison ivy at a very young age). Apart from spamming the usual batchest, this stream was really HARD for me watch and not get banned.",
    "i would like to suggest that you make a competition on your discord or kinda dating show that who wins in the final stage will have chance to go out real date with you . and only 2 guys can win . this may boost popularity for any streamer, and who know u might find someone who worth it",
    "sorry , but when she is a successful streamer with fan base of men , she has to pay some taxes . she can't just make us fantasize on her because she is pretty sweet and adorable without any hope , this make us suffer and struggle not having fun... just give a chance for us to prove that we can be suitable",
    "its call a \"dragon shout\".. not \"phewuu\"\nYou seriously don't know anything about elder scrolls so why try milk it for content if you arent even going to bother paying attention to the lore.Go play some minecraft or something.",
    "Marry me please I'm serious really I like you angel I wish we be together.\n I wish we be together someday I love you princess",
    "the_black_stallion69: damn I would love to find out what that fucking mouth would feel like wrapped tight around my black cock because I bet you know how to work those pretty fucking lips of yours don't you bitch"
