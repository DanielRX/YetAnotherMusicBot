    "Two guys in the same lunch restaurant as me rn, asian place, they speak english even though they both are swedish. Hair hasnt been washed in a while, one has pyjamas wear and the other is dressed like a girl with fake tits. They are talking about marxism.\nThey refer to things in a internet way\nOne just said lmao\nInstead of laughing\nIm leaving",
    "I want to date Elina so bad. She is so cute and I love her so much. She has a cute smile and a cute face. She’s a gamer like me and has a amazing personality. I would love to tell her every night “I love you” and rub her feet while she is streaming. We would go out when she isn’t doing gamer stuff and have fun together. She is also really good at gaming so I would be able to get carried by my very own GF. I love girls who are better at things than me so I can learn from them. God I want to date Elina",

    "Today's stream was really good. Just keeping aside the cosplay and elina's personality, the vibe was alright. But getting back to the real stuff, there wasn't one second for the entire time that I watched that I could focus on anything other than ogling at elina like a caveman (maybe that has something to do with me as a person but idk). Even then, after doing almost 2.5km of swimming drills, after which I'm usually fucking hammered, I still managed to watch the stream till the end and I couldn't keep my eyes off again (red hair is my weakness and the DC cartoons made me fall in love with poison ivy at a very young age). Apart from spamming the usual batchest, this stream was really HARD for me watch and not get banned."
